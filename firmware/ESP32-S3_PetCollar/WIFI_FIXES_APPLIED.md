# ‚úÖ WiFi Connection Stability Fixes Applied

## üö® **Problem Summary**
The collar was reverting to AP mode (192.168.4.1) after initially connecting to WiFi, causing the setup screen to reappear. This was caused by several race conditions and timing issues in the WiFi state management.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Fixes Applied**

### **1. ‚è∞ Improved Connection Timing**
```cpp
// OLD: Aggressive timeouts
#define WIFI_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT 15000  // 15 seconds
#define WIFI_RETRY_DELAY 5000          // 5 seconds

// NEW: More reasonable timeouts  
#define WIFI_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT 30000  // 30 seconds - more time for slow networks
#define WIFI_RETRY_DELAY 10000         // 10 seconds between retries
#define CREDENTIAL_SAVE_DELAY 5000     // 5 seconds delay after saving credentials
```

### **2. üîí Connection Attempt Locking**
```cpp
// NEW: Added connection state management
bool connectionInProgress = false;        // Prevent concurrent attempts
unsigned long connectionStartTime = 0;   // Track connection timing

void attemptWiFiConnection() {
  // Prevent concurrent connection attempts
  if (connectionInProgress) {
    Serial.println("‚ö†Ô∏è Connection attempt already in progress - skipping");
    return;
  }
  connectionInProgress = true;
  // ... connection logic
}
```

### **3. üïí Reduced State Machine Frequency**
```cpp
// OLD: State machine ran every loop iteration (every ~10ms)
void loop() {
  handleWiFiStateMachine();  // Too frequent!
}

// NEW: State machine runs every 2 seconds
void loop() {
  static unsigned long lastWiFiStateCheck = 0;
  if (millis() - lastWiFiStateCheck > 2000) {
    handleWiFiStateMachine();
    lastWiFiStateCheck = millis();
  }
}
```

### **4. üõ°Ô∏è Safer WiFi Mode Management**
```cpp
// OLD: Aggressive reset that could clear settings
WiFi.mode(WIFI_OFF);        // Could clear stored credentials
delay(500);
WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);

// NEW: Conservative approach that preserves settings
WiFi.disconnect(true);      // Disconnect but keep settings
delay(1000);               // Longer stabilization delay
```

### **5. üîç Fixed Network Scanning Issues**
```cpp
// OLD: Mode switching during scan that disrupted connections
void handleWiFiScan() {
  if (currentMode != WIFI_AP_STA) {
    WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP_STA);  // ‚ùå Disrupted ongoing connections
  }
  // ... scan
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP);        // ‚ùå Forced back to AP mode
}

// NEW: Safe scanning without mode disruption
void handleWiFiScan() {
  // Prevent scanning during active connection attempts
  if (connectionInProgress) {
    server.send(200, "text/html", "‚ö†Ô∏è Please wait for connection to complete...");
    return;
  }
  // Don't change WiFi mode - ESP32 can scan in current mode
  int networks = WiFi.scanNetworks(false, true);
}
```

### **6. üîÑ Connection Lock Management**
All connection success/failure paths now properly clear the connection lock:
```cpp
// On successful connection:
connectionInProgress = false;  // Clear lock

// On connection failure:
connectionInProgress = false;  // Clear lock

// On mode setup failure:
connectionInProgress = false;  // Clear lock
```

### **7. ‚è≥ Proper Credential Save Timing**
```cpp
// OLD: Too fast transition
delay(1000);                    // Only 1 second
attemptWiFiConnection();

// NEW: Proper stabilization time
delay(CREDENTIAL_SAVE_DELAY);   // 5 seconds for stability
attemptWiFiConnection();
```

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

### **Before (Problematic)**:
- ‚ùå Connection attempts could race with each other
- ‚ùå Network scanning disrupted active connections  
- ‚ùå State machine ran too frequently (every 10ms)
- ‚ùå Aggressive WiFi resets cleared stored settings
- ‚ùå Too-short timeouts caused premature AP mode fallback
- ‚ùå Immediate retries after credential saves

### **After (Fixed)**:
- ‚úÖ Connection attempts are properly serialized
- ‚úÖ Network scanning respects ongoing connection attempts
- ‚úÖ State machine runs at reasonable intervals (every 2 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Conservative WiFi management preserves settings
- ‚úÖ Generous timeouts allow slow networks to connect
- ‚úÖ Proper delays after credential saves for stability

## üß™ **Testing Results Expected**

With these fixes, the collar should:

1. **‚úÖ Stay Connected**: Once connected to WiFi, it should remain connected and not revert to AP mode
2. **‚úÖ Survive Power Cycles**: WiFi credentials should persist through power cycles
3. **‚úÖ Handle Slow Networks**: 30-second timeout accommodates slower network connections
4. **‚úÖ Prevent Race Conditions**: Connection attempts won't interfere with each other
5. **‚úÖ Safe Network Scanning**: Users can scan for networks without disrupting active connections

## üîß **How to Test**

1. **Connect to collar AP**: `PetCollar-Setup` (192.168.4.1)
2. **Select your WiFi network** and enter password
3. **Wait for connection** (up to 30 seconds)
4. **Verify it stays connected** (doesn't revert to AP mode)
5. **Power cycle test**: Turn off/on and verify auto-reconnection
6. **Scan test**: Try scanning networks while connected (should not disrupt)

## üìù **Files Modified**

- `firmware/ESP32-S3_PetCollar/ESP32-S3_PetCollar.ino` - Main firmware with all stability fixes

The fixes are backward-compatible and don't change the user interface or API endpoints. They only improve the internal state management for better reliability.
