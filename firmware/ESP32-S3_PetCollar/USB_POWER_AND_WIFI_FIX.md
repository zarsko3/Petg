# USB Power Detection & WiFi IP Reporting Fix

## Summary
Fixed two critical issues for USB-powered development and WiFi connectivity troubleshooting.

## ✅ Issue 1: Low Battery Alerts on USB Power
**Problem**: Device was triggering low battery alerts when running on USB power instead of battery.

**Solution**: Implemented smart USB power detection system.

### Features Added:
- **Automatic USB Detection**: Detects when running on USB power (>4.5V)
- **Alert Suppression**: Disables low battery alerts in USB mode
- **Manual Override**: `usbmode` command to toggle USB mode manually
- **Clear Status**: Status command shows current power mode
- **Smart Defaults**: USB mode enabled by default for development

### Configuration:
```cpp
#define USB_POWER_MODE true              // Default to USB mode
#define USB_VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD 4.5        // Voltage threshold for USB detection
```

### Serial Commands:
- `usbmode` - Toggle USB power mode on/off
- `status` - Shows current power mode and alert status

## ✅ Issue 2: WiFi IP Address Reporting
**Problem**: IP address wasn't being reported clearly after WiFi connection.

**Solution**: Enhanced WiFi initialization with comprehensive reporting.

### Improvements:
- **Detailed Connection Info**: Shows IP, Gateway, DNS, Signal strength
- **Better Error Handling**: Specific error messages for connection failures
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Built-in suggestions for common issues
- **Access URLs**: Direct links to web interface and APIs
- **Extended Timeout**: Increased connection timeout for reliability

### Enhanced Reporting:
```
✅ WiFi Connection Successful!
📊 Network Information:
   SSID: YourNetwork
   IP Address: 192.168.1.100
   Gateway: 192.168.1.1
   Subnet: 255.255.255.0
   DNS: 192.168.1.1
   Signal Strength: -45 dBm
   Channel: 6
   MAC Address: 24:6F:28:XX:XX:XX

🌐 Access URLs:
   Web Interface: http://192.168.1.100/
   WebSocket: ws://192.168.1.100:8080
   API Status: http://192.168.1.100/api/status
```

### New Serial Commands:
- `wifiinfo` - Detailed WiFi status and network information
- `status` - Now includes IP address when connected

## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### For USB Development:
1. USB power mode is enabled by default
2. No low battery alerts will trigger
3. Use `status` to confirm USB mode is active
4. Use `usbmode` to toggle if needed

### For Battery Operation:
1. Set `USB_POWER_MODE false` in code, or
2. Use `usbmode` command to disable USB mode
3. Low battery alerts will function normally

### WiFi Troubleshooting:
1. Use `wifiinfo` for detailed connection status
2. Check the troubleshooting suggestions in serial output
3. Verify 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
4. Use `restart` to retry connection

## 🎯 Benefits

### Development:
- ✅ No annoying low battery alerts during USB development
- ✅ Clear power mode indication
- ✅ Easy switching between USB and battery modes

### Deployment:
- ✅ Comprehensive WiFi diagnostics
- ✅ Clear IP address reporting
- ✅ Built-in troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ Professional network information display

### Reliability:
- ✅ Automatic power source detection
- ✅ Longer WiFi connection timeout
- ✅ Better error handling and reporting
- ✅ Enhanced debugging capabilities

## 📝 Technical Details

### USB Power Detection Logic:
1. Check `USB_POWER_MODE` flag (default: true)
2. Measure ADC voltage on battery pin
3. If voltage > 4.5V, assume USB power
4. Disable low battery alerts in USB mode
5. Show USB power status in debug output

### WiFi Enhancement Logic:
1. Clear previous connection state
2. Extended connection timeout (30 attempts vs 20)
3. Progress indication during connection
4. Comprehensive network information gathering
5. Specific error code interpretation
6. Built-in troubleshooting suggestions

## 🚀 Ready for Use
Both fixes are now active and ready for testing. The device will automatically detect USB power and provide comprehensive WiFi connection information.
