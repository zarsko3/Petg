# üö® Buzzer Test Results

## Test Environment
- **Date**: [Fill in test date]
- **ESP32 Board**: [e.g., ESP32 DevKit v1]
- **Buzzer Type**: [Active/Passive, Model if known]
- **Wiring**: Pin 25 -> Buzzer +, GND -> Buzzer -

## Test Results

### Digital Pulse Test
- **Status**: [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail
- **Notes**: [Did you hear clicking sounds?]

### PWM Frequency Tests
Fill in which frequencies produced sound:

| Frequency | Result | Volume | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 500 Hz    | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |
| 1000 Hz   | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |
| 1500 Hz   | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |
| 2000 Hz   | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |
| 2500 Hz   | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |
| 3000 Hz   | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |
| 4000 Hz   | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |
| 5000 Hz   | [ ] ‚úÖ [ ] ‚ùå | Low/Med/High | |

### Frequency Sweep Test
- **Status**: [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail
- **Notes**: [Did you hear a rising tone?]

## Best Working Frequency
- **Optimal Frequency**: [e.g., 2000 Hz]
- **Reason**: [Loudest, clearest, most reliable]

## Hardware Verification
- [ ] Wiring checked with multimeter
- [ ] Voltage measured on Pin 25 during test: ___V
- [ ] Buzzer tested with external power source

## Recommendations for Production Code
Based on test results:

1. **Use Frequency**: [Best working frequency]
2. **PWM Resolution**: 8-bit (tested and working)
3. **API Method**: Old ESP32 API (`ledcSetup`) - proven compatibility
4. **Volume Setting**: [Optimal duty cycle, e.g., 128 = 50%]

## Issues Found
- [ ] No issues
- [ ] Wiring problem
- [ ] Frequency-specific buzzer
- [ ] Power supply issue
- [ ] Other: [Describe]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Integrate working settings into main firmware
- [ ] Test with main collar hardware
- [ ] Verify in production environment
