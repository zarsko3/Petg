# ðŸ§ª Firmware Testing Directory

This directory contains isolated test firmware for debugging and validating hardware components before integration into the main codebase.

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Hardware Validation
- Upload test firmware to fresh ESP32
- Document results in respective test-results.md files
- Verify hardware functionality before code integration

### 2. Component Integration
- Once individual components work, test combinations
- Use integration-test directory for multi-component tests

### 3. Production Integration
- Only integrate tested and validated code into main firmware
- Keep test code separate for future debugging

## Current Test Status

- [ ] Buzzer Test - In Progress
- [ ] BLE Test - Pending
- [ ] Display Test - Pending
- [ ] Integration Test - Pending

## Notes

- Always test on fresh ESP32 device first
- Document all test results
- Keep test code simple and focused
- Separate concerns for easier debugging
